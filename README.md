##1 Introduction
Consider an Account class. It should have two methods:
• Deposit(double amount) which should increase the account’s balance with
the amount, the amount should always be positive
• Withdraw(double amount) which on the other hand should decrease the
account’s balance. Also this amount should be positive. If the amount
exceeds the balance, the balance should be left untouched and an exception
should be thrown.
